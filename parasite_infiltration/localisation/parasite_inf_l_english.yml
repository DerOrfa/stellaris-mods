[Leader.GetSheHeCap] claims that the mechanism for the air lock was broken and that it took [Leader.GetHerHim] days to repair it. But luckily the atmosphere in what [Leader.GetSheHe] descibes as an ancient temple was breathable.\n\nConsidering what [Leader.GetName] has been trough [Leader.GetSheHe] seems to be in a remarkable shape. [Leader.GetSheHeCap] says that this experience has somehow energized [Leader.GetHerHim] and that [Leader.GetSheHe] is eager to return to duty.\n\nAltough the air lock still can't be opened from the outside, [Leader.GetName] assures us that it is safe and that we should set up a permanent research station. So our scientists can ivestigate the temple further."
